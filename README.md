## React / Redux Firebase Demo

### Get Started
Make a new project directory (or cheat and clone [the repo](https://github.com/cif/firebase-redux))

`npm init`

Next, let's install the modules. I could have used one of now thousands of ES6 dev boilerplates however,
I feel that as front end engineers we should start from scratch at least a few times each year. Otherwise
you'll end up with a bloated thing that feels more like a framework than a library and `yarn` or `npm i` takes
10 minutes.

### Webpack
`npm i webpack webpack-dev-server --save-dev`

### Babel
`npm i babel-core babel-loader babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread babel-plugin-transform-runtime babel-preset-es2015 babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx babel-preset-react --save-dev`

### React, Redux et al.
`npm i react react-dom react-redux redux redux-actions redux-thunk --save`

### Sauce
`npm i react-hot-loader --save-dev`

### Firebase
`npm i firebase --save`

### Lint & Tests (developer's choice)
`npm i _____ --save-dev`
